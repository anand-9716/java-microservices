# java-microservices

As part of self learning, I have written three microservices - all three developed using three different frameworks. These three microservices are assumed to be the backend of a basic e-commerce webiste/platfrom. 

- **microservice-customers** ---> developed using *payara* framework
- **microservice-payments**  ---> is a *spring-boot* application developed using *spring-mvc* framework
- **microservice-orders**    ---> pure Java EE application which uses JAX-RS.

Apart from learning the nuances of REST based microservices and Services architecture, I also played around with *OAuth* and implemented it in payments and orders microservices respectively.
